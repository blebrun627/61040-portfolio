**Top 3 Domains:** 

*Working Out*: Playing sports and being active has been a big part of my life since I was little, so staying in shape is something I care a lot about and has always been a big interest of mine. I think working out and "gym culture" in general has become very popularized in recent years so an app in this domain could be very viable. I also just think theres a lot of different pathways that be taking with this from customization to shring ideas.

*Reading Books*: Reading has always been one of my favorite hobbies and something I tend to do whenevr I need to destress. It also has a very large market with it being so accessible in many different forms. I think it's a really easy way to make connections and bond over a story that you love.

*Task Management*: I'm a very anxious person and feel completely out of control if I don't have my life planned out to a T, so task management and organization is very important to me. I'm often trying new methods to see what works best which I think is true of many people as they search to find the best combination of features. 

**Problems:**

*Working Out*:

    1. Lack of workout consistency -> many people struggle to stick to a routine despite wanting to.
    2. Finding workout partners -> people often want someone to train with but struggle to find the right match.
    3. Gym intimidation for beginners -> people feel overwhelmed or out of place in gym environments.

*Reading Books*:

    1. Finding others to discuss books with -> book clubs are hard to coordinate or access.
    2. Difficulty choosing the next book -> endless options and reading slumps make it hard to decide what to read.
    3. Struggling to finish books/Burnout -> readers start strong but drop off before completing.

*Task Management*: 

    1. Difficulty prioritizing tasks -> people often confuse urgent with important.
    2. Falling off task systems -> people set up task apps but stop using them after a few weeks.
    3. Balancing short-term vs long-term goals -> difficult to keep both visible in daily planning.



**Top 3 Problems**:

    1. Connecting with Readers (Finding others to discuss books with) -- Despite the fact that we are all more online now and its very easy to communicate with the world around us, it can be difficult to find others that are interested in the same type of media as you. In most cases, people are only able to discuss what they're reading with a friend who started the book at the same time as them or if they've joined a designated bookclub. I often have moments where I read something incredibly interesting in a book and have no one to talk to about it or I'm forced to spoil the entire thing to a friend who will never read it so they can understand the emotions I'm experiencing. I think solving this problem could be very beneficial to the reading community and allow for more sharing of ideas about literature and media in general. 

    2. Matching workout partners (Finding workout partners) -- Working out can be an incredibly daunting task when you're doing it alone, especially if you're new to the gym. It can be scary to be in an unfamiliar place and intimidating to try new exercises around those who seem more experienced than you. In my own life, I've found it a lot more motivating and enjoyable to go to the gym with a friend as opposed to alone. It takes off a lot of the pressure, gives you a reason to keep going when your body wants to stop and overall it can be more fun to work out with someone else. I think especially for new gym-goers who don't have anyone in their life to workout with, this would be a very useful app to help them make connections that in turn could aid them in maintaining the habit of working out and help paint it in a more fun, enjoyable light overall. 

    3. Choosing the next book (Difficulty choosing the next book) -- In my own experience, I've gone in and out of many reading slumps where despite having many unread books I can't decide what to read next. Taking the burden of decision making away, especially if its a choice customized to your own interest would be a lot more interesting. You no longer have to make a difficult choice and in the event you don't like the choice given to you, you're more likely to have an idea of what you actually want to read. The element of surprise of not knowing what you'll get next is also a nice addition that adds to the fun of reading the next book.

**Unselected Problems**:

    1. Lack of workout consistency -- This problem kind of overlaps with the problem of finding a workout partner, since consistency often improves with accountability. Focusing on partner-matching feels like a more direct and concrete path to a solution.
    2. Gym intimidation for beginners -- Addressing this well would likely require changes to gym environments or in-person coaching, which are hard to capture in a project like this.
    3. Struggling to finish books/Burnout -- It can stem from many personal factors (time, interest, energy) that are difficult to solve with a single system. It’s harder to design a clear, software-based intervention compared to helping people connect or choose books.
    4. Difficulty prioritizing tasks -- It overlaps with many existing tools that already attempt prioritization. Any solutions may be too generic and less engaging compared to other apps already out there
    5. Falling off task systems -- People abandon systems for many reasons, which makes it harder to tackle in one single approach.
    6. Balancing short-term vs long-term goals -- This is often a  highly individualized issue, making it difficult to design a general solution. It’s also more abstract and less immediately relatable than other task management challenges.

**Stakeholders**:

*Connecting with Readers*

    1. Booksellers: With more commentary surrounding a book, there's a good chance for a fluctuation in ratings which can impact sales at book stores.
    2. Readers: These are the direct users, who benefit from teh experience of using the software
    3. Authors/Publishers: In the same way as booksellers, if the commentary on a book causes the ratings to increase, it could lead to more sales of said book which increases the profits of authors & publishers.

    Readers are the most directly affected, since they often want to share thoughts and reactions to books but may not know others who have read the same title. Without a community, the reading experience can feel less engaging and isolating. Booksellers also have a stake in this problem, as discussions often spark new purchases, and stronger reading communities can encourage repeat customers. Authors and publishers benefit as well, since word-of-mouth remains one of the most powerful drivers of book sales and reputation, and easier reader connections could amplify visibility for their work.
*Matching workout partners*

    1. Gym Owners: If people are more motivated to continue going to the gym, this means they'll have to maintain a gym membership which increases profits for gym owners.
    2. Gym-Goers: Being more motivated to workout is beneficial for the average gym-goer as it allows them to stay in healthy and oftentimes build confidence in themselves.
    3. Sports & Fitness Equipment Companies: With increase in gym-goers, there would be more incentive to increase the amount of equipment in a gym to match demand, which would lead to more progit for equipment companies.

    Gym-goers are directly affected because many struggle to stay consistent and motivated when exercising alone, and a reliable workout partner can provide accountability, encouragement, and shared progress. Gym owners and trainers are indirectly impacted, as members who feel socially connected are more likely to stay engaged and keep attending, which improves retention and builds a stronger community around the facility. Healthcare and fitness professionals are also connected to this issue, since consistent exercise is tied to better long-term health outcomes, and partner support can help patients maintain healthier routines. Even broader stakeholders, like fitness equipment companies and universities or recreation centers, may benefit when more people sustain their workout habits, since that can drive higher equipment use and greater participation in organized fitness spaces.
*Choosing the next book*

    1. Readers: These are the direct users who want the more persnalized, less burdensome recommendations.
    2. Booksellers: When readers discover new books they don't own and need to buy, book sellers directly profit from this.
    3. Libraries: If a reader is completely sold on a recommendation and doesn't want to buy it yet they have the option to borrow from a library. This increases the foot traffic and book circulation within libraries.

    Readers are most directly affected by the challenge of choosing their next book, as the overwhelming number of options often leads to indecision, wasted time, or reading slumps. This has ripple effects for booksellers, who lose potential sales if readers hesitate or avoid buying altogether, and for libraries, which rely on strong circulation to demonstrate their value and serve their communities effectively. Authors and publishers are also stakeholders, since better recommendation systems could help diversify which works gain attention, bringing visibility not only to bestsellers but also to emerging voices and niche genres.

**Features**:

*Connecting with Readers*

Line-By-Line Commenting: Readers can have a e-version of the book they're reading and cna make comments on their opinions to certain lines. These comments are shared to other readers who can leave their own thoughts or replpy to other comments.
Reader Profiles & Interests: Profiles could highlight favorite genres, authors, or reading pace, helping readers connect with like-minded peers and encouraging booksellers/authors to better understand audiences.
Instant Discussion Matchmakin: After finishing a book, readers could instantly be paired with others who recently completed the same title. This lowers the barrier to entry compared to searching for book clubs and helps readers feel less isolated.

*Matching workout partners*

Goal & Schedule Matching: Users enter their fitness goals (strength, endurance, weight loss, etc.) and availability, and the system pairs them with a compatible partner. This directly addresses the difficulty of finding someone with aligned needs.

Accountability Tracking: Shared check-ins or progress logs allow partners to see when the other has completed workouts, adding social accountability for consistency. This supports both gym-goers and gym owners by encouraging regular attendance.

Safety & Compatibility Filters: Options to filter by fitness level, preferred exercises, or even comfort level (e.g., same-gender partners) make the system safer and more comfortable, reducing barriers like gym intimidation.

*Choosing the next book*

Mood & Context-Based Suggestions: Instead of generic algorithms, users can select moods or contexts (e.g., “light and fun,” “intense and serious”) to get more relevant book recommendations. This aligns better with readers’ immediate interests.

Community Endorsements: Readers can see what people with similar tastes recently enjoyed, combining personalization with social trust. This supports authors and booksellers by surfacing less mainstream works.

Decision-Simplifying Tools: Features like “flip a coin,” “shortlist showdown,” or daily polls help reduce analysis paralysis by narrowing choices quickly. This makes the process less stressful and keeps readers engaged.
